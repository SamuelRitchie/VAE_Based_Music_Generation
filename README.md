This repository contains scripts, data and a report for VAE based music generation, for the course "Techniques Avancées d'Apprentissage",
given by Stéphan Clémençon @ENSAE ParisTech in Spring 2018. Note that the repository has to be cloned in order to visualise the python notebook.


This project aims at trying to generate music (and in a first time images) thanks to a particular type of generative model : Variational Auto-Encoders. 
This method was first described by Diederik P. Kingma and Max Welling in *Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes* (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf) and today achieves state of the art results along with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in data generation (text, image, music). Below are two examples of celebrity images generated with VAEs:
